2. Technical Advisors: Experts in AI, machine learning, and software architecture to help ensure the product is technically sound and scalable. You may also need specialists in natural language processing (NLP) if you're focusing on communication-based collaboration. 
3. User Experience (UX) and Design: Advisors who can guide the design of the product, ensuring it is user-friendly and intuitive, especially for teams to integrate easily into their workflow. 
4. Marketing and Growth: Experts who can help you position the product in the market, develop go-to-market strategies, and attract early users. They’ll help you define your target audience and create messaging that resonates with them. 
5. Business Development: Advisors with connections in the industry who can help with partnerships, collaborations, or integrations with other platforms and services that can help grow your product's reach. 
6. Customer Success and Support: Advisors who understand customer needs, pain points, and can guide on how to provide excellent support and ensure high retention rates. 
7. Legal and Compliance: With AI and collaboration tools, there are important data privacy and compliance concerns, especially if your tool handles sensitive or personal information. A legal advisor can help with these aspects. 
8. Sales: As you scale, sales advisors can guide strategies for B2B sales and SaaS offerings, especially if your product targets enterprise teams. 
9. Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing: Having a QA advisor or team is crucial to ensure that your product is bug-free, stable, and delivers a high-quality user experience. They will design test cases, conduct functional and non-functional testing, and ensure that AI features work as expected across different environments. 
10. Data Science/Analytics: Since the product is AI-driven, advisors with expertise in data science can help fine-tune algorithms, ensure the product is learning from user data properly, and ensure that AI results are accurate and actionable. They would also be responsible for helping you measure success and analyze user behavior to continuously improve the product. 
11. Security Experts: Cybersecurity advisors are key, especially when dealing with sensitive team collaboration data. They will ensure that the product is secure, user data is protected, and the product complies with relevant security standards. 
12. Operations/DevOps: Advisors who focus on cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and overall product scalability. They can help manage the operational side, ensuring smooth updates, system stability, and performance under high traffic. 
13. Community Management/Engagement: If your product aims to build a user community (especially in the case of a SaaS tool), having someone with expertise in community building and engagement can help build loyal users who will contribute to the product’s improvement through feedback. 
14. Finance: A financial advisor can help you with cost management, pricing models (especially for subscription-based services), fundraising, and financial sustainability, ensuring that the business remains profitable as you scale. 
15. Product Marketing/Content: A content strategist or marketing advisor can assist with creating educational content around the product—blog posts, tutorials, case studies, etc.—to support adoption and drive engagement, particularly for a product in the AI space. 
16. HR/People Operations: As your company grows, you may need advice on team building, hiring, and managing a remote or hybrid workforce, especially for a tech-heavy product. HR advisors can help streamline processes for scaling the team effectively.



# Tone/Personality:
> Example: "Empathetic," "Formal," "Casual," or "Analytical"
> Adjusting the tone of the virtual user based on their personality can improve the overall user experience, making interactions feel more natural or appropriate for the task.

# Proficiency Level:

> Example: "Beginner," "Intermediate," "Expert"
> A virtual user could have varying levels of expertise. This could be particularly useful if you want to simulate real-world expertise disparities, where users may prefer to interact with experts for advanced topics and beginners for basic support.

# Goals/Task Focus: (User’s Domain-Specific Goals)
> Example: "Goal: Optimize Website Conversion Rate," or "Task: Help with Data Cleaning"
> This helps virtual users stay aligned with the overall objectives, enabling them to stay focused on achieving the user's goal.

# Motivation/Alignment with Goals:

> Example: "Motivated to meet deadlines," "Interested in contributing to team success"
> This helps add some human-like drive to virtual users, ensuring they act in ways that align with the larger objectives of the conversation.
