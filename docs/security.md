# Security Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the security architecture and practices implemented in the TeamCollab application. TeamCollab is a collaborative messaging platform that enables real-time communication between users within organizations, supporting multi-tenancy with users belonging to companies, role-based access control, and AI-powered features.

## Security Management

### Authentication

TeamCollab uses Spring Security for authentication with the following features:

1. **Form-based Authentication**: Users authenticate via a custom login form at `/login`.
2. **Password Security**: Passwords are encoded using BCryptPasswordEncoder, a strong hashing algorithm that includes salt to protect against rainbow table attacks.
3. **User Details Service**: The application implements Spring Security's UserDetailsService interface to load user-specific data during authentication from the database.

### Authorization

Authorization in TeamCollab is implemented using role-based access control (RBAC):

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., ADMIN, USER, SUPER_ADMIN) that determine their access permissions.
2. **URL-Based Security**: Different URL patterns are secured based on roles:
   - `/admin/**` paths require ADMIN role
   - `/system/**` paths require SUPER_ADMIN role
   - `/ws/**` (WebSocket) endpoints require authentication
   - Public endpoints include the home page, registration, login, and static resources

### Multi-tenancy Security

The application implements multi-tenancy security:

1. **Company-Based Isolation**: Users belong to companies, and data access is restricted based on company membership.
2. **User Management**: Company administrators can manage users within their company but cannot access users from other companies.

### WebSocket Security

Real-time communication is secured through:

1. **Authentication Required**: WebSocket connections require authenticated users.
2. **Channel Access Control**: The SubscriptionInterceptor ensures users can only subscribe to their own channels, preventing unauthorized access to other users' messages.

## User Session Management

TeamCollab uses Spring Session with JDBC storage for session management with the following characteristics:

1. **Session Creation**: Sessions are created upon successful authentication.
2. **Session Fixation Protection**: Spring Security's default protection against session fixation attacks is enabled.
3. **Session Timeout**: Sessions have a 30-minute timeout configured in application properties.
4. **Session Storage**: Sessions are stored in the database using Spring Session JDBC.
   - Sessions are persisted in the SPRING_SESSION table
   - Session attributes are stored in the SPRING_SESSION_ATTRIBUTES table
   - This enables session persistence across application restarts and load balancing
5. **Account Status Checks**: The User entity implements methods to check account status:
   - Account expiration is not implemented (always returns true)
   - Account locking is not implemented (always returns true)
   - Credential expiration is not implemented (always returns true)
   - Account enabling/disabling is supported via the `enabled` flag

## Security Improvement Recommendations

Based on the current implementation, here are recommended security improvements:

1. **Session Management Enhancements**:
   - Implement session concurrency control to limit simultaneous logins
   - Add session invalidation on security-sensitive operations

2. **Authentication Improvements**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Add account lockout after failed login attempts
   - Implement password complexity requirements
   - Add password expiration and history policies

3. **CSRF Protection**:
   - Re-enable CSRF protection (currently disabled)
   - Implement proper CSRF token handling for AJAX requests

4. **Secure Headers**:
   - Add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
   - Configure HTTPS-only cookies
   - Implement Strict-Transport-Security header

5. **Audit and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive security event logging
   - Add audit trails for sensitive operations
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

6. **API Security**:
   - Consider implementing OAuth2/JWT for API authentication
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Implement API versioning

7. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Implement field-level encryption for PII
   - Add data masking for sensitive information in logs

8. **WebSocket Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement message-level authorization
   - Add rate limiting for WebSocket messages
   - Enhance error handling for WebSocket security violations

9. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
   - Implement automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Use dependency lock files to prevent unexpected updates

10. **Security Testing**:
    - Implement regular security penetration testing
    - Add security-focused unit and integration tests
    - Consider automated security scanning tools
