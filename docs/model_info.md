### Explanation of Columns

1. **Description of the LLM Model**
    - Provides a concise overview of each model's capabilities, including its context size (the maximum number of tokens
      it can process in a single input).
    - Example: GPT-4 Turbo has a 128,000-token context size and supports multimodal inputs, while GPT-3.5 Turbo is
      limited to 4,096 tokens and focuses on chat optimization.

2. **Cost per 1M Tokens for Input and Output**
    - Costs are token-based, with output tokens typically more expensive than input tokens. Exact figures vary and are
      not specified in the provided data, so relative terms are used:
        - **Low cost**: GPT-3.5 Turbo (cheapest option).
        - **Medium cost**: GPT-4o mini (cost-effective alternative).
        - **High cost**: GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-mini (advanced models).
        - **Very high cost**: OpenAI o1-preview (premium reasoning model).

3. **API Model Name**
    - The identifier used to access the model via the OpenAI API (e.g., "gpt-4-turbo").

4. **Model Name**
    - The official or common name of the model (e.g., "GPT-4 Turbo").

5. **Ratings (1-10) for Specific Tasks**
    - Ratings are based on model descriptions and performance metrics:
        - **Summarization, Classification, Topic Identification**: GPT-4 models score higher (8-9) due to advanced
          capabilities; o1-mini scores slightly lower (8) in non-STEM areas; GPT-3.5 Turbo scores 7 as an older model.
        - **Speed**: Based on output tokens per second where available (e.g., o1-mini: 237 tokens/s = 10; GPT-4 Turbo:
          39.3 tokens/s = 3). GPT-3.5 Turbo is assumed fast (9) due to its smaller size.
        - **Instruction Following, Structure Output**: Higher for newer GPT-4 and o1 models (8-9); GPT-3.5 Turbo at 7.
        - **Reasoning**: o1 series excels (10) due to STEM optimization; others score 7-9.
        - **Perform Tasks with Minimal Examples**: Reflects few-shot learning ability, higher in GPT-4 and o1 models (
          8-9) than GPT-3.5 Turbo (7).

### Notes

- **Context Size**: Most GPT-4 and o1 models support 128,000 tokens, enabling longer inputs, while GPT-3.5 Turbo is
  capped at 4,096 tokens.
- **Cost**: Specific pricing requires reference to OpenAI's official pricing page, but relative costs align with model
  complexity and capabilities.
- **Ratings**: Inferred from qualitative descriptions and quantitative speed data where available, ensuring consistency
  with known model strengths.
