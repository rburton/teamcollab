# Useful Features for Assistant Row in TeamCollab

## Introduction
The assistant row in TeamCollab provides a quick way to access and interact with AI assistants. To enhance user experience and productivity, the following features could be implemented for each assistant row.

## Conversation Management Features

### 1. Quick Actions Menu
- **Add to Conversation**: Quickly add the assistant to the current conversation
- **Remove from Conversation**: Remove the assistant from the current conversation
- **Pin/Favorite**: Mark frequently used assistants for quick access

### 2. Content Management
- **Export Conversation**: Export the conversation with this assistant to various formats:
  - Google Docs
  - PDF
  - Markdown
  - Plain text

## Assistant Customization

### 1. Persona Management
- **Modify Response Length**: Set preference for concise or detailed responses

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these features, consider:
- Progressive disclosure of options to avoid overwhelming the UI
- Contextual menus that appear only when relevant
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Consistent placement of common actions
- Clear visual feedback when actions are taken

These features would significantly enhance the utility of the assistant row, making it not just a visual element but a powerful control center for AI-assisted collaboration.


Allow for a user to change the tone of an assistant within a conversation. This would be saved on the ConversationAssistant class.

Adjust between formal, casual, technical, or simplified communication styles.
