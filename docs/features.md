## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these features, consider:
- Progressive disclosure of options to avoid overwhelming the UI
- Contextual menus that appear only when relevant
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Consistent placement of common actions
- Clear visual feedback when actions are taken

These features would significantly enhance the utility of the assistant row, making it not just a visual element but a powerful control center for AI-assisted collaboration.


Allow for a user to change the tone of an assistant within a conversation. This would be saved on the ConversationAssistant class.

Adjust between formal, casual, technical, or simplified communication styles.
