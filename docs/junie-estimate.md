## Task Breakdown and Estimates

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration (1 day)
- Add WebSocket dependencies to pom.xml (0.5 hours)
- Create WebSocketConfig with proper annotations and security (2 hours)
- Configure STOMP endpoints and message broker (1.5 hours)
- Setup basic error handling structure (4 hours)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (2 days)
- Create ChatMessage DTO with Lombok annotations (1 hour)
- Implement WebSocket controller with proper annotations (4 hours)
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation (4 hours)
- Implement WebSocket event listener (3 hours)
- Add logging and monitoring setup (4 hours)

### Phase 3: UI Implementation (1.5 days)
- Update HTML templates with Thymeleaf integration (3 hours)
- Implement WebSocket client connection handling (3 hours)
- Add real-time message handling (4 hours)
- Implement reconnection logic (2 hours)

### Phase 4: Testing (1.5 days)
- Write unit tests for WebSocket components (4 hours)
- Create integration tests (4 hours)
- Implement end-to-end tests (4 hours)

## Timeline Estimates

### Base Estimate: 6 days (48 hours)

### Scenario Analysis
1. Best Case: 5 days (40 hours)
   - Smooth integration with existing codebase
   - No major browser compatibility issues
   - Minimal security complications
   - Efficient parallel development

2. Worst Case: 9 days (72 hours)
   - All risk factors materialize
   - Complex error handling scenarios
   - Security implementation challenges
   - Extended testing requirements

3. Most Likely: 6-7 days (48-56 hours)
   - Some minor technical challenges
   - Normal testing iteration
   - Standard code review cycle

### Hours Breakdown
- Phase 1: 8 hours
- Phase 2: 16 hours
- Phase 3: 12 hours
- Phase 4: 12 hours

### Parallel Development Opportunities
1. UI Implementation can start in parallel with Core Implementation
2. Test writing can begin during Core Implementation
3. Documentation can be done throughout the development

### Task Dependencies
1. Phase 1 must be completed before:
   - WebSocket controller implementation
   - Client-side connection handling

2. Core Implementation must be completed before:
   - End-to-end testing
   - Full UI integration

### Risk Factors and Contingencies
1. Technical Risks (+1-2 days):
   - Complex error handling scenarios
   - Browser compatibility issues
   - Performance optimization needs

2. Integration Risks (+1 day):
   - Existing codebase conflicts
   - Security implementation complexity
   - Third-party library compatibility

3. Testing Risks (+1 day):
   - Test environment setup issues
   - Complex test scenarios
   - Performance testing challenges

### Factors Considered
1. Junie's Development Guidelines:
   - Comprehensive error handling requirement
   - Logging in critical paths
   - Use of Lombok annotations
   - Function size limitations
   - Code style requirements

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Java 21 features
   - Spring Boot 3.4 integration
   - Thymeleaf template engine
   - TailWind CSS styling

3. Testing Requirements:
   - JUnit Jupiter implementation
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Integration testing

### Resource Requirements

#### Team Composition
1. Development Team:
   - 1 Senior Backend Developer (Java/Spring)
   - 1 Frontend Developer (JavaScript/Thymeleaf)
   - 1 QA Engineer

2. Support Resources:
   - DevOps Engineer (part-time)
   - Technical Lead (oversight)

#### Technical Resources
1. Development Environment:
   - Java 21 development setup
   - Spring Boot 3.4 environment
   - WebSocket testing tools
   - Browser testing infrastructure

2. Testing Resources:
   - Test environment with WebSocket support
   - Load testing tools
   - Browser automation tools

### Notes
- Estimate assumes familiarity with Junie's development guidelines
- Includes time for code review and documentation
- Accounts for proper error handling and logging
- Considers the need for comprehensive testing
- Team members should have experience with WebSocket implementation
- Assumes availability of required technical resources
