Create a new class called ActionItem that has the following information:

1. A reference to the message that triggered the action item
2. Any date/time the item is expected to be done.
3. A status for instance, In Progress, Open, Closed
4. A note about what the action item is about
5. the category the action is in reference to
6. The date/time the item was created
7. The date/time the item was deleted
8. The conversation the Action item is in reference to

When summarizing a message a user sent,
determine if the message is saying to create an action item that needs to be done at a later day.

When an Action Item is detected in a message, create an ActionItem class and save it in the database.
